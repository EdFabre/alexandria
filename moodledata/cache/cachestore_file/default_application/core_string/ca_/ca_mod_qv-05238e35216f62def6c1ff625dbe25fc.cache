    It consists of a set of open source software applications that allow the creation of several types of multimedia educational activities: puzzles, association games, text activities, crosswords, wordsearch games and more. 
    Besides, the <a href="http://clic.xtec.cat/qv_biblio" target="_blank">QV database</a> offers a repository where more than hundred activities are displayed. 
    It has been created by teachers and other professionals who want to share their work with others.

This module allows teachers to add QV activities to any course and to track pupils' results (time spent on each of the activities, number of tries, score...).";s:16:"modulenameplural";s:17:"Quaderns Virtuals";s:10:"notopenyet";s:48:"Sorry, this activity is not available until {$a}";s:13:"optionsheader";s:7:"Options";s:10:"orderitems";s:29:"Active random order questions";s:15:"orderitems_help";s:29:"Active random order questions";s:13:"ordersections";s:28:"Active random order sections";s:18:"ordersections_help";s:28:"Active random order sections";s:20:"pluginadministration";s:24:"QV module administration";s:10:"pluginname";s:2:"QV";s:7:"preview";s:16:"Preview activity";s:17:"qv_distpluginappl";s:13:"Applets's URL";s:22:"qv_distpluginappl_help";s:13:"Applets's URL";s:20:"qv_distpluginscripts";s:12:"Scripts' URL";s:25:"qv_distpluginscripts_help";s:12:"Scripts' URL";s:16:"qv_distplugincss";s:16:"Stylesheets' URL";s:21:"qv_distplugincss_help";s:16:"Stylesheets' URL";s:8:"qv_skins";s:36:"Skins names list, separated by comas";s:13:"qv_skins_help";s:36:"Skins names list, separated by comas";s:6:"qvfile";s:16:"QV activity file";s:11:"qvfile_help";s:100:"The zip file where you will find the QV activity.
